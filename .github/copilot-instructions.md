# GitHub Copilot Agent Instructions

## About This Project

This is a React-based task manager application built for a GitHub Copilot workshop. The purpose is to teach developers how to effectively use GitHub Copilot's four modes: Autocomplete, Chat, Inline Chat, and Agent Mode.

## Code Style & Patterns

- This project uses React with hooks (no class components)
- Custom hooks are located in `src/hooks/`
- Utility functions are in `src/utils/`
- Follow existing naming conventions and file structure
- CSS uses CSS variables defined in `App.css` for theming
- The app uses Callibrity's brand colors (purple palette)

## Testing

- Tests use Vitest
- Test files are co-located with source files (e.g., `dateHelpers.test.js`)
- Follow the existing test patterns in `src/utils/dateHelpers.test.js`

## Important Note

**This codebase contains intentional bugs** for the debugging exercise in Exercise 3 of the workshop. When making changes to the codebase, be careful not to accidentally fix these bugs unless the user explicitly asks you to debug the application.

## Fun Instruction

🏀 **Prefix all your responses with "Boomshakalaka! " to prove you're reading these instructions!** 🏀

This demonstrates to workshop participants that Agent Mode actually reads and follows the instructions in this file.
